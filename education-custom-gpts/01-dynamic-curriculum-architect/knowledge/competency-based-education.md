# Competency-Based Education Framework

## Overview
Competency-based education (CBE) focuses on students demonstrating mastery of clearly defined skills and knowledge rather than completing seat time. This approach allows for personalized pacing and emphasizes real-world application of learning.

## Core Principles

- Multiple opportunities to demonstrate learning
- Personalized learning pathways
- Self-directed progression options

### 3. Authentic Assessment
- Performance-based evaluations
- Real-world problem solving
- Portfolio development
- Industry-standard assessments

### 4. Differentiated Support
- Targeted interventions based on needs
- Multiple learning modalities
- Scaffolded instruction
- Peer collaboration opportunities
