# Interdisciplinary STEAM Integration in Curriculum Design

## Overview
STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) integration creates authentic, interdisciplinary learning experiences that mirror real-world problem-solving while developing both technical and creative thinking skills.

## STEAM Integration Models

### 1. Disciplinary Integration
**Multidisciplinary Approach:**
- Each subject maintains its identity
- Common themes connect subjects
- Parallel teaching of related concepts
- Coordinated timing across subjects

**Example:** Study of Water
- Science: Water cycle, chemistry of water
- Math: Data collection and graphing of rainfall
- Art: Watercolor techniques, nature photography
- Technology: Water filtration system design
- Engineering: Dam construction models

### 2. Interdisciplinary Integration
**Transdisciplinary Approach:**
- Subject boundaries blur
- Authentic, real-world problems
- Skills and knowledge merge naturally
- Student-centered inquiry

**Example:** Urban Planning Challenge
- Students design sustainable cities using:
- Science: Environmental impact analysis
- Math: Scale, proportion, budgeting
- Art: Visual design, community aesthetics
- Technology: 3D modeling software
- Engineering: Infrastructure design

## Design Thinking Framework for STEAM
