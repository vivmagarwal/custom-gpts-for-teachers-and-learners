# Major Curriculum Development Frameworks

## Understanding by Design (UbD) - Backward Design

### Key Principles:
- Start with the end in mind
- Design from standards and learning goals
- Plan assessments before instruction
- Create learning experiences that lead to desired outcomes

### Three Stages:
1. **Identify Desired Results**: What should students know, understand, and be able to do?
2. **Determine Acceptable Evidence**: How will you know if students achieved the desired results?
3. **Plan Learning Experiences**: What teaching and learning activities will equip students with needed knowledge and skills?

### Essential Questions Framework:
- Open-ended, thought-provoking
- Require higher-order thinking
- Point toward big ideas and transfer
- Recur naturally throughout learning

## Standards-Based Curriculum Design

### Components:
- **Standards Alignment**: Clear connections to state/national standards
- **Learning Progressions**: Sequential skill building
- **Proficiency Scales**: Clear performance levels
- **Assessment Integration**: Standards-aligned evaluation

### Implementation Process:
1. Unpack standards into learning targets
2. Create proficiency scales
3. Design formative assessments
4. Plan instructional sequences
5. Monitor and adjust based on data

## Inquiry-Based Learning Model

### Characteristics:
- Student-driven questions
- Investigation and exploration
- Evidence-based conclusions
- Real-world connections
- Collaborative learning

### Inquiry Cycle:
1. **Ask**: Generate authentic questions
2. **Investigate**: Research and explore
3. **Create**: Synthesize learning
4. **Discuss**: Share and refine understanding
5. **Reflect**: Evaluate process and learning

## Project-Based Learning (PBL) Framework

### Essential Elements:
- **Challenging Problem**: Authentic, complex issues
- **Sustained Inquiry**: Extended investigation over time
- **Authenticity**: Real-world connections
- **Student Voice & Choice**: Agency in learning process
- **Reflection**: Continuous learning improvement
- **Critique & Revision**: Peer and expert feedback
- **Public Product**: Share learning with authentic audience

### Planning Template:
- Driving Question
- Learning Objectives
- Assessment Plan
- Resources and Materials
- Timeline and Milestones
- Reflection Opportunities

## Integrated/Interdisciplinary Approach

### Benefits:
- Real-world connections
- Transfer of learning
- Efficient use of time
- Deeper understanding
- Student engagement

### Integration Models:
- **Multidisciplinary**: Themes across subjects
- **Interdisciplinary**: Shared concepts and skills
- **Transdisciplinary**: Problem-based integration

## International Baccalaureate (IB) Framework

### Programme Structure:
- **Primary Years Programme (PYP)**: Ages 3-12
- **Middle Years Programme (MYP)**: Ages 11-16
- **Diploma Programme (DP)**: Ages 16-19

### Key Features:
- International-mindedness
- Inquiry-driven learning
- Conceptual understanding
- Global contexts
- Action and service

## Competency-Based Education

### Principles:
- Students advance based on mastery
- Learning objectives are explicit
- Assessment is meaningful
- Students receive differentiated support
- Learning outcomes emphasize application

### Implementation Elements:
- Clear competency statements
- Performance-based assessment
- Flexible pacing
- Multiple pathways
- Continuous feedback
