# High-Impact Teaching Practices: Research to Practice

## John Hattie's High-Impact Strategies (Effect Sizes)

### Top-Tier Strategies (Effect Size > 0.6):

**1. Feedback (0.70)**
*Research Finding*: Specific, timely feedback about performance gaps accelerates learning.

*Implementation*:
- Provide feedback within 24-48 hours
- Focus on specific aspects of performance
- Include next steps for improvement
- Use descriptive rather than evaluative language
- Connect feedback to learning goals

*Example*: Instead of "Good job," write "Your thesis statement clearly states your position. To strengthen your argument, add specific evidence in paragraph 2."

**2. Reciprocal Teaching (0.74)**
*Research Finding*: Students teaching other students enhances understanding for both parties.

*Implementation*:
- Pair students with complementary strengths
- Provide clear teaching protocols
- Train students in explanation strategies
- Monitor and support peer interactions
- Rotate teaching roles regularly

**3. Meta-Cognitive Strategies (0.69)**
*Research Finding*: Teaching students to think about their thinking improves learning outcomes.

*Implementation*:
- Explicitly teach planning strategies
- Model thinking processes aloud
- Use reflection prompts after activities
- Teach self-monitoring techniques
- Encourage strategy selection and evaluation

**4. Direct Instruction (0.59)**
*Research Finding*: Clear, structured teaching of specific skills and knowledge is highly effective.

*Implementation*:
- Begin with clear learning objectives
- Model skills or procedures explicitly
- Provide guided practice opportunities
- Check for understanding frequently
- Move to independent practice gradually

### Classroom Discussion Strategies (0.82):

**Accountable Talk Practices**:
- Students build on each other's ideas
- Require evidence for claims
- Listen carefully to understand
- Respect different perspectives
- Use academic language

**Discussion Protocols**:
- Think-Pair-Share variations
- Socratic seminars
- Fish bowl discussions
- Debate formats
- Literature circles

### Worked Examples (0.57):

*Research Finding*: Providing step-by-step examples reduces cognitive load and improves learning.

*Implementation*:
- Show complete problem-solving process
- Think aloud during demonstrations
- Gradually fade support (scaffolding)
- Provide multiple example types
- Connect examples to underlying principles

## Retrieval Practice Research

### The Testing Effect:
*Research Finding*: Retrieving information from memory strengthens long-term retention better than repeated studying.

**Low-Stakes Testing Strategies**:
- Daily warm-up quizzes
- Exit tickets with recall questions
- Weekly cumulative reviews
- Flash card activities
- Brain dumps (free recall)

**Optimal Timing**:
- Immediate retrieval (within class)
- Short delay (next day)
- Medium delay (one week)
- Long delay (one month)
- Spiraling review

### Spaced Practice:
*Research Finding*: Distributing practice over time is more effective than massed practice.

**Implementation**:
- Review previous content regularly
- Interleave old and new material
- Create cumulative assessments
- Use spiral curriculum design
- Build in systematic review cycles

## Classroom Management Research

### Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS):
*Research Finding*: Proactive, positive approaches to behavior are more effective than reactive punishment.

**Implementation**:
- Clearly define behavioral expectations
- Teach expected behaviors explicitly
- Acknowledge positive behaviors consistently
- Provide corrective feedback calmly
- Use data to inform decisions

### Relationship Building:
*Research Finding*: Positive teacher-student relationships are foundational to learning and behavior.

**Strategies**:
- Learn student names quickly
- Show personal interest in students
- Maintain high expectations for all
- Communicate care and support
- Be culturally responsive

## Questioning and Discussion Research

### Higher-Order Questioning:
*Research Finding*: Questions that require analysis, synthesis, and evaluation promote deeper learning.

**Bloom's Taxonomy Question Stems**:
- **Analyze**: "How does X relate to Y?" "What patterns do you notice?"
- **Evaluate**: "What criteria would you use to judge...?" "Which solution is best and why?"
- **Create**: "How might you design...?" "What would happen if...?"

### Wait Time Research:
*Research Finding*: Increasing wait time after questions improves response quality and participation.

**Implementation**:
- Wait 3-5 seconds after asking questions
- Wait 3-5 seconds after student responses
- Use think time explicitly
- Avoid filling silence too quickly
- Encourage thinking before speaking

## Differentiation Research

### Carol Ann Tomlinson's Research:
*Research Finding*: Tailoring instruction to student readiness, interest, and learning profile improves outcomes.

**Differentiation by**:
- **Content**: What students learn
- **Process**: How students learn
- **Product**: How students demonstrate learning
- **Learning Environment**: Context for learning

### Universal Design for Learning (UDL):
*Research Finding*: Providing multiple means of representation, engagement, and expression benefits all learners.

**Implementation**:
- Offer content in multiple formats
- Provide various ways to engage with material
- Allow different ways to show learning
- Build in flexibility from the start

## Technology Integration Research

### SAMR Model (Substitution, Augmentation, Modification, Redefinition):
*Research Finding*: Technology's impact increases when it transforms rather than just digitizes learning.

**Implementation Examples**:
- **Substitution**: Digital worksheets
- **Augmentation**: Interactive online quizzes
- **Modification**: Collaborative online documents
- **Redefinition**: Global virtual collaborations

### TPACK Framework (Technology, Pedagogy, Content Knowledge):
*Research Finding*: Effective technology integration requires understanding of all three components.

**Implementation**:
- Choose technology that supports learning objectives
- Ensure pedagogical soundness
- Maintain focus on content mastery
- Integrate all three seamlessly

## Assessment and Grading Research

### Formative Assessment Research:
*Research Finding*: Frequent, low-stakes assessment improves learning more than infrequent, high-stakes testing.

**Effective Formative Assessment**:
- Provides specific feedback
- Occurs during learning process
- Involves students in assessment
- Informs instructional decisions
- Builds student metacognition

### Standards-Based Grading:
*Research Finding*: Grading based on learning standards rather than points improves motivation and achievement.

**Implementation**:
- Separate academic and behavior grades
- Allow multiple opportunities to demonstrate learning
- Focus on most recent evidence
- Provide clear proficiency criteria
- Use feedback more than grades

## Culturally Responsive Teaching Research

### Geneva Gay's Research:
*Research Finding*: Teaching that connects to students' cultural backgrounds improves engagement and achievement.

**Implementation**:
- Learn about student cultures
- Include diverse perspectives in curriculum
- Use culturally relevant examples
- Validate students' home languages
- Connect learning to student experiences

### Asset-Based Approach:
*Research Finding*: Focusing on student strengths rather than deficits improves outcomes.

**Strategies**:
- Identify and build on student strengths
- Use students' experiences as learning resources
- Maintain high expectations for all students
- Provide multiple pathways to success
- Celebrate diverse forms of intelligence
