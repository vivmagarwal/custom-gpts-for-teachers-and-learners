# Evidence-Based Practice Translation in Education

## Overview
Evidence-based practice translation involves systematically converting research findings into practical, implementable strategies that improve educational outcomes while considering contextual factors, stakeholder needs, and implementation feasibility.

## Research Evidence Hierarchy
