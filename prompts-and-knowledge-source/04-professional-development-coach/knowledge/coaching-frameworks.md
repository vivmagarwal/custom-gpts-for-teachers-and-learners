- Experience serves as resource for learning
- Mistakes and failures become learning opportunities

**3. Readiness to Learn**
- Learning is most effective when it addresses immediate needs
- Problem-centered rather than content-centered approach
- Just-in-time learning is preferred

**4. Orientation to Learning**
- Task-oriented and practical focus
- Immediate application is valued
- Real-world problem solving

**5. Motivation**
- Internal motivators are stronger than external ones
