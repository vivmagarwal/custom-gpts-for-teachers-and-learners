- Compliance monitoring and reporting

**Student Data Governance:**
- Clear data collection justifications
- Minimal data collection principles
- Purpose limitation enforcement
- Regular data inventory audits
- Stakeholder consent management

## State-Level Privacy Regulations

### 1. Student Data Privacy Legislation
**Common State Requirements:**
- Enhanced consent requirements for data collection
- Mandatory data breach notifications
- Restrictions on commercial use of student data
- Requirements for data privacy officer appointment
- Annual privacy impact assessments

**California Student Data Privacy Laws:**
- Student Online Personal Information Protection Act (SOPIPA)

- Restrictions on behavioral advertising

### 2. Emerging State Regulations
**AI-Specific Requirements:**
- Algorithm impact assessments
- Bias testing and mitigation plans
- Human oversight requirements
- Transparent decision-making processes
- Regular AI system audits

## Digital Record Keeping Best Practices

### 1. Data Classification and Handling
**Classification Levels:**
- Public: Directory information (with consent)
- Internal: General educational information
- Confidential: Academic records and assessments
- Restricted: Special education and disciplinary records
- Highly Restricted: Health and psychological records

**Handling Procedures:**
- Role-based access controls
- Multi-factor authentication requirements
- Regular access review and recertification
- Secure data transmission protocols
- Audit logging and monitoring

### 2. Data Retention and Disposal
**Retention Schedules:**
- Academic records: Varies by state (typically 5-7 years)
- Special education records: 7 years after graduation
- Disciplinary records: Varies by severity and state law
- Health records: Follow medical record retention rules
- Assessment data: Align with testing program requirements

**Secure Disposal Methods:**
- Digital data: Cryptographic erasure or physical destruction
- Physical records: Cross-cut shredding or incineration
- Verification of complete data removal
- Certificate of destruction documentation
- Chain of custody maintenance

### 3. Incident Response and Breach Notification
**Incident Response Plan:**
- Immediate containment procedures
- Forensic investigation protocols
- Risk assessment and impact analysis
- Notification timeline requirements
- Recovery and remediation procedures

**Notification Requirements:**
- Department of Education (FERPA violations)
- State education agencies (state law requirements)
- Affected students and parents
- Law enforcement (if criminal activity suspected)
- Media and public (for significant breaches)

## Workflow Automation Compliance

### 1. Automated Decision-Making
**FERPA Considerations:**
