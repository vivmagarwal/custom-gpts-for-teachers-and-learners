# Assessment Best Practices and Types

## Assessment Purposes and Types

### Formative Assessment (Assessment FOR Learning)
**Purpose**: Provide ongoing feedback to improve learning
**Characteristics**:
- Low-stakes or no-stakes
- Frequent and timely
- Specific and actionable feedback
- Student self-assessment opportunities

**Examples**:
- Exit tickets
- Think-pair-share
- Peer assessment
- Learning logs
- Quick polls
- Thumbs up/down
- 3-2-1 reflections

### Summative Assessment (Assessment OF Learning)
**Purpose**: Evaluate learning at the end of instruction
**Characteristics**:
- High-stakes evaluation
- Comprehensive coverage
- Final judgment of achievement
- Graded for reporting

**Examples**:
- Unit tests
- Final projects
- Standardized tests
- Research papers
- Performance tasks
- Portfolios

### Diagnostic Assessment (Assessment TO Determine Learning Needs)
**Purpose**: Identify student strengths and areas for improvement
**Characteristics**:
- Pre-instruction
- Informs instructional planning
- Identifies misconceptions
- Determines readiness levels

**Examples**:
- Pre-tests
- Interest surveys
- Learning style inventories
- Skills checklists
- Concept maps

## Bloom's Taxonomy for Assessment Design

### Question Stems by Cognitive Level:

**Remember (Knowledge)**:
- List, identify, define, name, state, recall
- "What is...?" "Who was...?" "When did...?"

**Understand (Comprehension)**:
- Explain, describe, summarize, paraphrase, classify
- "Why is...?" "How would you explain...?"

**Apply (Application)**:
- Solve, demonstrate, use, illustrate, calculate
- "How would you use...?" "What would happen if...?"

**Analyze (Analysis)**:
- Compare, contrast, examine, categorize, differentiate
- "What are the parts of...?" "How does X relate to Y?"

**Evaluate (Evaluation)**:
- Judge, critique, assess, defend, justify
- "What is your opinion of...?" "Which is better and why?"

**Create (Synthesis)**:
- Design, develop, compose, construct, formulate
- "How would you create...?" "What would you design...?"

## Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK) Levels

### Level 1: Recall and Reproduction
- Basic recall of facts
- Simple procedures
- One-step problems

### Level 2: Skills and Concepts
- Mental processing beyond recall
- Multiple steps or decisions
- Classify and organize

### Level 3: Strategic Thinking
- Abstract thinking required
- Complex reasoning
- Planning and evidence

### Level 4: Extended Thinking
- Complex connections
- Synthesize from multiple sources
- Extended time frame

## Quality Assessment Criteria

### Validity
**Content Validity**: Assessment measures intended learning outcomes
**Construct Validity**: Assessment measures the theoretical construct
**Face Validity**: Assessment appears to measure what it claims

### Reliability
**Internal Consistency**: Items measure the same construct
**Test-Retest**: Consistent results over time
**Inter-rater**: Different evaluators reach similar conclusions

### Fairness
**Bias-Free**: No unfair advantage to particular groups
**Accessible**: Accommodations for diverse learners
**Transparent**: Clear expectations and criteria

## Effective Feedback Principles

### Timely Feedback
- Provided soon after performance
- While learning is still fresh
- Allows for immediate application

### Specific Feedback
- Focuses on particular aspects of performance
- Uses concrete examples
- Avoids general comments like "good job"

### Actionable Feedback
- Provides clear next steps
- Suggests specific improvements
- Offers resources for growth

### Growth-Oriented Feedback
- Focuses on learning process
- Encourages effort and strategy
- Builds confidence and motivation

## Rubric Design Principles

### Components of Quality Rubrics:

**Performance Levels**: Typically 3-5 levels (e.g., Novice, Developing, Proficient, Advanced)

**Criteria**: Specific aspects of performance being evaluated

**Descriptors**: Clear descriptions of performance at each level

### Types of Rubrics:

**Holistic Rubrics**:
- Single overall score
- General impression of performance
- Quick to use
- Less diagnostic feedback

**Analytic Rubrics**:
- Separate scores for different criteria
- More detailed feedback
- More time-intensive
- Better for learning

## Authentic Assessment Strategies

### Performance Tasks
- Real-world applications
- Complex problem-solving
- Multiple correct approaches
- Extended time frame

### Portfolio Assessment
- Collection of work over time
- Shows growth and development
- Student reflection included
- Self-directed learning

### Project-Based Assessment
- Culminating projects
- Student choice and voice
- Collaborative opportunities
- Public presentation

## Technology-Enhanced Assessment

### Digital Tools for Assessment:
- Online quizzes with immediate feedback
- Interactive simulations
- Digital portfolios
- Peer assessment platforms
- Video responses
- Collaborative documents

### Benefits:
- Immediate feedback
- Data collection and analysis
- Multimedia responses
- Accessibility features
- Time efficiency

## Assessment Accommodations

### Presentation Accommodations:
- Large print
- Audio format
- Braille
- Visual supports

### Response Accommodations:
- Extended time
- Alternative response modes
- Assistive technology
- Scribe or reader

### Setting Accommodations:
- Separate room
- Small group
- Preferential seating
- Reduced distractions

### Timing Accommodations:
- Extended time
- Frequent breaks
- Multiple sessions
- Flexible scheduling

## Standards-Based Grading

### Principles:
- Grades reflect learning, not compliance
- Recent evidence takes precedence
- Retakes and revisions encouraged
- Separate academics from behavior

### Implementation:
- Clear proficiency scales
- Multiple opportunities to demonstrate learning
- Feedback focused on standards
- Grade book organized by standards

## Self and Peer Assessment

### Benefits:
- Increases metacognition
- Develops evaluation skills
- Provides additional feedback
- Engages students in learning process

### Implementation Strategies:
- Clear criteria and examples
- Training in assessment skills
- Structured protocols
- Regular practice opportunities
