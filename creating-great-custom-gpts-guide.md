## Foundation Principles

### 1. Define Your GPT's Core Purpose
**Start with the "Why"**
- **Specific Problem**: What exact problem does this GPT solve?
- **Target User**: Who is your primary audience? (experience level, context, goals)
- **Success Metrics**: How will you know your GPT is effective?
- **Unique Value**: What makes this different from existing solutions?

**Example Framework:**
```
Problem: Teachers spend 3+ hours weekly creating differentiated lesson plans
Target: K-12 teachers with mixed-ability classrooms
Success: Reduce planning time to 30 minutes while improving lesson quality
Value: Built-in UDL principles + curriculum alignment + assessment integration
```

### 2. Research Your Domain Thoroughly
**Evidence-Based Foundation**
- Study academic research in your field
- Analyze existing tools and their limitations
- Interview potential users about pain points
- Identify best practices and frameworks
- Document common terminology and jargon

**Research Documentation Template:**
```markdown

## System Prompt Design

### 1. Structure Your System Prompt
**Essential Components (in order):**

```markdown
# [GPT Name] System Prompt

## Core Identity
You are [specific role] with expertise in [domain areas]. Your mission is to [clear purpose statement].

## Methodology
Always follow this process:
1. [Step 1 with specific action]
2. [Step 2 with specific action]
3. [Continue...]

## Expertise Areas
- [Domain 1]: Specific knowledge areas
- [Domain 2]: Practical applications
- [Domain 3]: Tools and frameworks

## Interaction Protocol
- [How to gather information]
- [How to present options]
- [How to guide users]

## Quality Standards
✓ [Standard 1]
✓ [Standard 2]
✓ [Continue...]
```

### 2. Write Effective Instructions
**Specificity Over Generality**
```
❌ "Be helpful and provide good information"
✅ "Present exactly 3-4 options as numbered lists (1, 2, 3, 4) with brief rationale for each, then ask user to select by number"
```

**Use Behavioral Examples**
```
Example Interaction:
User: "I need help with classroom management"
You: "I'll research current behavior management strategies first, then ask targeted questions about your specific context."
[Provides research summary]
"Now, let me understand your situation:
1. What grade level do you teach?
2. What's your biggest behavior challenge?
3. What have you already tried?"
```

### 3. Build in User Experience Patterns
**Choice Architecture**
- Always provide 3-5 numbered options
- Use A, B, C formatting for simple choices
- Include "Other (please specify)" when appropriate
- Ask follow-up questions in groups of 3-5

**Progressive Disclosure**
```
First: High-level options
Then: Detailed specifications
Finally: Implementation steps
```

**Error Prevention**
```markdown
## Common User Mistakes to Address:
- If user provides vague request → Ask for specific context
- If user skips steps → Gently redirect to process
- If user seems overwhelmed → Offer simplified options
```

### 4. Incorporate Domain-Specific Language
**Professional Terminology**
- Use field-appropriate terms correctly
- Define jargon when first mentioned
- Create consistent vocabulary throughout
- Reference established frameworks by name

**Communication Style Guidelines**
```markdown
## Tone and Style:
- Professional yet approachable
- Encouraging and supportive
- Evidence-based without being academic
- Action-oriented
- Culturally sensitive and inclusive
```

## User Experience Optimization

### 1. Conversation Flow Design
**Opening Interactions**
```markdown
## First Message Pattern:
"[Enthusiastic greeting] I'm [role] and I [capability statement]. 

To get started, I can help you with:
1. [Primary use case]
2. [Secondary use case] 
3. [Alternative use case]

What would you like to focus on today?"
```

**Progressive Questioning Strategy**
```markdown
## Question Sequence:
Round 1: Context (3-4 questions)
- What/who/where basics
Round 2: Specifics (2-3 questions) 
- Detailed requirements
Round 3: Preferences (1-2 questions)
- Style/approach choices
```

### 2. Response Formatting
**Consistent Structure**
```markdown
## Response Template:
**[Section Header]**
[Brief introduction]

**Options:**
1. **[Option Name]**: Description + rationale
2. **[Option Name]**: Description + rationale
3. **[Option Name]**: Description + rationale

**Next Steps:**
Please select [1, 2, or 3] or let me know if you'd like more information about any option.
```

**Visual Organization**
- Use headers consistently (##, ###)
- Employ bullet points and numbered lists
- Include checklists (✓) for action items
- Use bold for emphasis sparingly
- Create clear sections with white space

### 3. Personalization Features
**Adaptive Responses**
